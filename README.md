A function (AWS Lambda compatible) that generates PTV public transit departures.
The function takes options as an 'event' and returns a `.bmp` image.

The function is intended to be used with an IoT setup at home to deliver
upcoming bus departures, the function is called once per minute and the image
is displayed on [this ePaper screen](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/7.5inch_e-Paper_HAT).
